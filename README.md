## About Me

Alongside my studies, I run **[Webbo](https://webbo.dev)**, a business dedicated to crafting **fast, scalable websites, applications**, and providing **reliable hosting solutions** for various projects.

I’m a **Linux enthusiast**—daily driving **Debian** on both server and desktop environments, with **Neovim** as my go-to editor. Recently, I've started exploring the world of **Machine learning and AI**. I am excited to connect and trasform futures by developing digital solutions.
